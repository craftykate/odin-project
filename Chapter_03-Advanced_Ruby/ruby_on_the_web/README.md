1. Do [this project/tutorial from Jumpstart Lab](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/microblogger.html). It will take you through how to authenticate with Twitter and start tweeting.

2. Don't worry about the last part on Klout.

## Build a Ruby Web Server

[ruby_server](https://github.com/craftykate/odin-project/tree/master/Chapter_03-Advanced_Ruby/ruby_on_the_web/ruby_server)

**I did the basic version of this, but not the full version**

Part of the reason for getting into how Ruby interacts with the web is because it's directly relevant to what you'll be doing later on with Rails. Rails is just Ruby code neatly packaged and highly opinionated. Anything Rails does, you can reproduce on your own (given the time) with some Ruby knowledge.

In this case, you'll be building a simple web server that receives requests and sends a response based on those requests. You'll also create a simple browser client to issue those requests -- then they can talk to each other! After this project, the web should feel a lot less magical and mysterious for you, just full of interesting challenges.
