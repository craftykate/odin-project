# Rails Forms

Project Source: http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/forms

**Odin's Notes:** These projects will give you a chance to actually build some forms, both using nearly-pure HTML and then graduating to using the helper methods that Rails provides. The tutorial chapter will cover integrating a signup form with your Rails application and providing help if the user enters incorrect information.
