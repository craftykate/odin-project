In your Ruby days to come, you'll inevitably run into times when you'll be working with CSV files and imperfect data. Seriously... there is no such thing as a perfect dataset. Any time you find what looks like the perfect batch of data on something interesting, whether you're trying to plot airline flight delays on a map, tease out the nuggets from a master list of nonprofits, or scrape 10,000 emails to mercilessly SPAM with your latest get-rich-quick scheme, it will be full of mistakes, omissions, and misspellings. Working with and cleaning up data go hand in hand.

This tutorial from Jumpstart Lab walks you through just that sort of operation. Give it a shot.
